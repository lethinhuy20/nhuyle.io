Logging can also damage aquatic habitats. Vegetation along rivers end stream
banks helps maintain a steady water flow by blocking the entry of soil and other
residue, while tree shade inhibits the growth of algae. Removing trees obliterates
these benefits. When eroding soil flows into waterways, the organic matter within it
consumes more oxygen, which can lead to oxygen depletion in the water, killing fish
and other wildlife.
(4) D
Trees provide a natural defense against air pollution. They remove carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere while they emit oxygen, and their leaves filter pollutants from
the air. Cutting down trees keeps pollutants airborne, where they can mix with water
vapor1 and form acid rain. Water quality in nearby streams and rivers also deteriorates
as tree loss contributes to increased sedimentation.
(5) E
In a healthy forest ecosystem, trees draw moisture from the soil and release it into
the atmosphere while they provide shade to lessen evaporation. Thus, deforestation
affects rainfall patterns, leading to flooding as well as drought and forest fires.
Deforestation is responsible forabout one-fifth of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide,
Making it a major contributor to climate change-in particular, global warming. In
the Amazon basin alone, deforestation is responsible for millions of tons of carbon
being released into the atmosphere annually. Some logging companies burn large
racts of forest just to facilitate access to one area—a practice2 that discharges even
lore carbon dioxide.

BARRON'S GIVES YOU",,,,
img5.jpg,"Prelude: Manchester, 1909
In a small room in a university laboratory a nervous young
man sat in darkness, waiting. Outside there was daylight, the
watery sunshine of an English afternoon in early spring, but
here the heavy black blinds were down and all was deepest
gloom. As silent minutes passed, the effect the young man
was hoping for gradually took place: his eyes were growing
accustomed to the conditions. He began to make out the dark
rectangle of the door, the black lines between the bare boards
of the floor, the shadowy form of the workbench where he
set up his apparatus. Still he waited, for he knew from
his training that the pupils of his eyes were not yet fully
dilated, as they had to be before he could proceed. And as
he sat he ran over in his mind the preparanons he had made
for the experiment he was about to carry out, ticking off a
mental checklist until he was sure nothing had been missed.
Then he rehearsed step by step what he must do next if he
vas to be confident his results would be sound. Only after
ad been sitting there for twenty minutes id he rise to
his feet.
Taking care not to look at the bulb, he switched on a very
weak electric lamp pointing into the apparatus, the perched
himself on a stool and leaned forward to the microscope. He
knew he would have to hold this position for some time, so
to make the job more comfortable he had covered the outer
part of the eyepiece with cork. Resting the side of his face
lightly upon this cushion and deliberately relaxing his body as
much as he could, he closed his other eye and began to focus.",,,,

the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice
suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a
volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change
to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out
imprecations on his persecutor.
His tale is connected, and told with an
appearance of the simplest truth; yet I own to you that
the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,
and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship
brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his
narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and
connected. Such a monster has, then, real existence! I
cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise and
admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from
Frankenstein the particulars of his creature’s
formation: but on this point he was impenetrable.
‘Are you mad, my friend?’ said he; ‘or whither
does your senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also
create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy?
Peace, peace! learn my miseries, and do not seek to
increase your own.’
Frankenstein discovered that I made notes
concerning his history: he asked to see them, and then
himself corrected and augmented them in many
places; but principally in giving the life and spirit to
the conversations he held with his enemy. ‘Since you
have preserved my narration,’ said he, ‘I would not
that a mutilated one should go down to posterity.
Thus has a week passed away, while I have
listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination
formed. My thoughts, and every feeling of my soul,
have been drunk up by the interest for my guest,
which this tale, and his own elevated and gentle
manners, have created. I wish to soothe hime; yet can I
counsel one so infinitely miserable, so distitute of
every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! the only joy
that he can now know will be when he composes his
shattered spirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one
comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium: he

Narrator: Listen to a class discussion about gifted children
Professor: I asked you to read an article about recognizing gifted students in the
classroom. So, tell me. How can a teacher recognize gifted children?
Student 1: One thing gifted children do is read. They usually read books for older
children, or sometimes books for adults.
Professor: Yes, that's an important sign. Profoundly gifted children, especially,
may be seen reading adult books at a very early age. What else?
Student 2: When it comes to problem solving, gifted children use sophisticated
approaches, unlike their peers.
Student 1: Not all the signs of giftedness are positive. Gifted children migth be
bored in the classroom and behave badly. They often need help with
discipline.
Professor: That’s exactly right, and one reason why it’s so important to recognize
these children and place them in the proper environment and give
them the support they need.
Student 2: One way to support them is to give them constructive activities that
are interesting to them. If they don’t have activities that satisfy their
inquisitiveness and creativity, that’s when discipline can become a
problem.
Student 1: And, of course, we need to provide a Special curriculum for these
children. They need more than just some interesting activities. They
need a whole course of study that matches their abilities.

Estimates of world sales value vary widely, but it probably reached $10 billion a year before 2000. SAP was founded in Walldorf, Germany in 1972, and is the world's largest 'inter-enterprise' solfware company. It emplys 25,000 people, in more than 50 companies and has '10 million users; 30,000 installa-tions; 1,000 partners'. You can see how quickly its market has grown from the fol-lowing revenues for ERP in the mid 1990s. Year 1994 1995 1996 1997 ERP licence revenue 692 1350 1730 2370 ($ million) Many other companies supply such tnte-grated software, including BAAN, JD Edwards, SSA, and PeopleSoft. Their very large systems have an average installation                                 cost of $15 million. Of this, 17% is for soft-ware, 14% for hardware, 46% for profes-sional services and 23% for internal staff costs, The time to implement the systems vary from under 18 months to over 30 months. After this, benefits begin to appear in about a year and it takes around five years to braekeven. Peter Burris of META Group summarises these results with the comment: To say that implementing ERM/ERP solu-tions requires an enormous commitment is an understatement.
