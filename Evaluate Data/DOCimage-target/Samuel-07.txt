Proven to be very effective.
In addition to the limitations imposed by forgetting, it
seemed desirable to place a restriction on the maximum
size of any one record. Whenever an arbitrary limit is
reached, enough of the lowest-ply board positions are
automatically culled from the record to bring the size
Well below the maximum.
Before embarking on a study of the learning capa-
bilities of the system as just described, it was, of course,
first necessary to fix the terms and coefficients in the
evaluation polynomial. To do this, a number of different
Sets of values were tested by playing through a series
of book games and computing the move correlation co-
efficients. These values varied from 0.2 for the poorest
polynomial tested, to approximately 0.6 for the one
finally adopted. The selected polynomial contained four
terms (as contrasted with the use of 16 terms in later
experiments). In decreasing order of importance these
were: (1) piece advantage, (2) denial of occupancy,
(3) mobility, and (4) a hybrid term which combined con-
trol of the center and piece advancement.
Rote-learning tests
After a scoring polynomial was arbitrarily picked, a series
of games was played, both self-play and play against
many different individuals (several of these being check-
er masters). Many book games were also followed, some
