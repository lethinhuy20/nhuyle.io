Logging can also damage aquatic habitats. Vegetation along rivers end stream
banks helps maintain a steady water flow by blocking the entry of soil and other
residue, while tree shade inhibits the growth of algae. Removing trees obliterates
these benefits. When eroding soil flows into waterways, the organic matter within it
consumes more oxygen, which can lead to oxygen depletion in the water, killing fish
and other wildlife.

Trees provide a natural defense against air pollution. They remove carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere while they emit oxygen, and their leaves filter pollutants from
the air. Cutting down trees keeps pollutants airborne, where they can mix with water
vapor1 and form acid rain. Water quality in nearby streams and rivers also deteriorates
as tree loss contributes to increased sedimentation.
(5) E
In a healthy forest ecosystem, trees draw moisture from the soil and release it into
the atmosphere while they provide shade to lessen evaporation. Thus, deforestation
affects rainfall patterns, leading to flooding as well as drought and forest fires.
Deforestation is responsible forabout one-fifth of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide,
Making it a major contributor to climate change-in particular, global warming. In
the Amazon basin alone, deforestation is responsible for millions of tons of carbon
being released into the atmosphere annually. Some logging companies burn large
racts of forest just to facilitate access to one areaâ€”a practice2 that discharges even
lore carbon dioxide.
ests, especially the tropical rainforests, are a vital natural resource with extensiy
iversity and irreplaceable wildlife habitats. More responsible logging practice
d help ensure that they are protected for future generations.
