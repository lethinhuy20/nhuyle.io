Unit 9: Education - Educating the Gifted
Narrator: Listen to a class discussion about gifted children
Professor: I asked you to read an article about recognizing gifted students in the
classroom. So, tell me. How can a teacher recognize gifted children?
Student 1: One thing gifted children do is read. They usually read books for older
children, or sometimes books for adults.
Professor: Yes, that's an important sign. Profoundly gifted children, especially,
may be seen reading adult books at a very early age. What else?
Student 2: When it comes to problem solving, gifted children use sophisticated
approaches, unlike their peers.
Student 1: Not all the signs of giftedness are positive. Gifted children migth be
bored in the classroom and behave badly. They often need help with
discipline.
Professor: That’s exactly right, and one reason why it’s so important to recognize

Student 2: One way to support them is to give them constructive activities that

problem.
Student 1: And, of course, we need to provide a Special curriculum for these
children. They need more than just some interesting activities. They
need a whole course of study that matches their abilities.

search. Often, people hire specialized lawyers to do this for them. Once
ascertained that there are no patients on inventions similar to yours, then
