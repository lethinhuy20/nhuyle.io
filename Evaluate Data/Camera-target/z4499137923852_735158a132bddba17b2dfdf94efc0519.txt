Prelude: Manchester, 1909
In a small room in a university laboratory a nervous young
man sat in darkness, waiting. Outside there was daylight, the
watery sunshine of an English afternoon in early spring, but
here the heavy black blinds were down and all was deepest
gloom. As silent minutes passed, the effect the young man
was hoping for gradually took place: his eyes were growing
accustomed to the conditions. He began to make out the dark
rectangle of the door, the black lines between the bare boards
of the floor, the shadowy form of the workbench where he
set up his apparatus. Still he waited, for he knew from
his training that the pupils of his eyes were not yet fully
dilated, as they had to be before he could proceed. And as
he sat he ran over in his mind the preparanons he had made
for the experiment he was about to carry out, ticking off a
mental checklist until he was sure nothing had been missed.
Then he rehearsed step by step what he must do next if he
vas to be confident his results would be sound. Only after
ad been sitting there for twenty minutes id he rise to
his feet.
Taking care not to look at the bulb, he switched on a very
weak electric lamp pointing into the apparatus, the perched
himself on a stool and leaned forward to the microscope. He
knew he would have to hold this position for some time, so
to make the job more comfortable he had covered the outer
part of the eyepiece with cork. Resting the side of his face
lightly upon this cushion and deliberately relaxing his body as
much as he could, he closed his other eye and began to focus.
